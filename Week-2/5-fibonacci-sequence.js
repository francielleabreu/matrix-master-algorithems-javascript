// Friday: Fibonacci Sequence
// A great friend of yours, Fibonacci, just came up with a sequence of numbers that is really easy to compute. However, 
// his time allows him to calculate by hand only the first 10-15 terms of the sequence; of course, he is busy trying
// to come up with some other interesting sequence. So he gives you the first terms and asks you to write an algorithm 
// that will return the n-th term in the sequence.
// His sequence looks like this: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...

// Immediately you find the pattern: setting the first two terms to be 1, any other term is the sum of the two previous 
// terms. 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8, 5+8=13 and so on.
// In this way, if n would be equal to 4 your result should be 3; but if n is 7, then the result is 13.
// But these are small numbers, which can be computed by hand. What about bigger numbers? Let's see what results you 
// will get for the following n's:

// n = 43 -> x
// n = 101 -> x
// n = 227 -> x
// n = 491 -> x
// n = 881 -> x

// function fibonacci(n) {
    
// }
// console.log("The 101st term is: " + fibonacci(10))
// console.log("The 227th term is: {fibonacci_dynamic(227)}")
// console.log("The 491st term is: {fibonacci_dynamic(491)}")
// console.log("The 881st term is: {fibonacci_dynamic(881)}")
