// Create an algorithm that inserts the numbers from 1 to 135 into an array, while replacing the values that are divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz", the numbers that are divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz", 
// and the numbers that are divisible with 3 and 5 with the word "FizzBuzz". Your output should look like [1,2, 'Fizz',4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz',7, 8, ...]
